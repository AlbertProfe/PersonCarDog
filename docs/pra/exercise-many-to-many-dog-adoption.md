# Exercise: Many-to-Many Dog Adoption — Shared Custody (Java SE / Pre-Spring Boot) — Part 2

## Objective

Evolve the adoption system from the previous **one-to-one** `adoptDog` into a **many-to-many** relationship.

- A `Person` can adopt **multiple dogs** (max 3 active).
- A `Dog` can have **multiple owners** (max 2 active — shared custody).
- `DogAdoption` becomes the explicit **join entity** (association class): one record per person-dog pair, carrying `fee`, `date`, and `status`.

All business logic must live in `Service.java`.  
All user interaction must live in `Controller.java` + `Utils.java`.

No JPA annotations in this exercise — pure Java SE. The mapping table at the end only shows how this will translate later.

## Context

- This is **Part 2** of the adoption story. You should have completed (or at least studied) the first "Adopt a Dog" exercise.
- Architecture remains simple DDD style (model, repository, service, controller/utils).
- `DogAdoption` is still read-only from the UI perspective (created only as a side-effect of `adoptDog` or modified only by `returnDog`).
- `buyCar` / `CarTransaction` and all CRUD remain unchanged.

## Business Rules

Shared custody with limits:

- A person may have **at most 3 active dogs** at any time.
- A dog may have **at most 2 active owners** at any time.
- No duplicate active pair: the same person cannot have two ACTIVE adoptions for the same dog.
- Only adults (`age >= 18`) can adopt.
- Adoption fee must be `>= 0`.
- `returnDog(person, dog)` ends **only that person's link** to the dog (the dog may still have other owners).
- Every adoption (past and present) is recorded as a `DogAdoption`.

## Requirements

### 1. Model — Refactor to Lists + Status

#### `Person`
- Replace the single reference:
  ```java
  // before (Part 1)
  private Dog dog;
  ```
  with a collection:
  ```java
  private List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<>();
  ```
- Add getter `getDogs()` and a method or setter to manage the list (Service will control mutations).
- Update `toString()` to avoid recursion (print only dog names or ids).

#### `Dog`
- Replace the single back-reference:
  ```java
  // before
  private Person owner;
  ```
  with:
  ```java
  private List<Person> owners = new ArrayList<>();
  ```
- Same recursion caution in `toString()`.

#### `DogAdoption` — Add Status
Keep the existing shape and add lifecycle state:
- `String id`
- `Person adopter`
- `Dog dog`
- `Date date`
- `int fee`
- `String contract`
- `String status`  (or an `enum AdoptionStatus { ACTIVE, RETURNED }`)
- On creation: `status = "ACTIVE"`
- On return: set `status = "RETURNED"` and append `" - RETURNED"` (or similar) to `contract`.

Provide empty constructor + full constructor, getters/setters, `toString()`.

### 2. Repository

You can reuse most of the existing `DogAdoption` methods. You may add lightweight helpers if useful:

- `getDogAdoptionsByPersonId(String personId)` → `ArrayList<DogAdoption>`
- `getDogAdoptionsByDogId(String dogId)` → `ArrayList<DogAdoption>`

Or implement the logic in Service using the existing `getAllDogAdoptions()`.

`clear()` / `isEmpty()` (if not already present) are useful for tests and reload scenarios.

### 3. Service Layer — Many-to-Many Use Cases

#### Core use case (refactored)
```java
public static ResultOperation adoptDog(Person adopter, Dog dog, int fee, Repository repo)
```

Validation chain (each failure returns `ResultOperation` with `false` + message, same style as Part 1):

1. `adopter` exists in repo
2. `dog` exists in repo
3. `adopter.getAge() >= 18`
4. `fee >= 0`
5. No duplicate ACTIVE pair: the person is not already actively linked to this dog via an adoption record (or check both lists).
6. `adopter.getDogs().size() < 3` → "Person already has the maximum number of dogs."
7. `dog.getOwners().size() < 2` → "Dog already has the maximum number of owners."

On success:
- Create `DogAdoption(adopter, dog, new Date(), fee, "Dog adopted for " + fee, "ACTIVE")`
- Add to both sides of the relation:
  - `adopter.getDogs().add(dog)`
  - `dog.getOwners().add(adopter)`
- `repo.addDogAdoption(adoption)`
- Print and return success with the adoption.

#### Read-only helpers
- `getDogsByOwner(Person person, Repository repo)` → `ResultOperation` (list of currently owned dogs)
- `getOwnersByDog(Dog dog, Repository repo)` → `ResultOperation` (list of current owners)
- Keep `getDogAdoptionById` and `getAllDogAdoptions`

#### Close one side of the relationship
```java
public static ResultOperation returnDog(Person person, Dog dog, Repository repo)
```

- Find the ACTIVE `DogAdoption` for this exact pair.
- If none exists → failure.
- Remove the link from both collections:
  - `person.getDogs().remove(dog)`
  - `dog.getOwners().remove(person)`
- Update the `DogAdoption`: set status `RETURNED`, append `" - RETURNED"` to contract.
- Print the updated adoption.
- Return success. The record stays in history.

#### Cascade on delete (update existing methods)
- `deletePerson`: before removing the person, for each dog in `person.getDogs()`:
  - remove the person from `dog.getOwners()`
  - mark every related `DogAdoption` for this person as `RETURNED`
- `deleteDog`: symmetrically, for each owner, remove the dog from their list and mark adoptions `RETURNED`.

Do **not** delete the `DogAdoption` records — only mark them returned (audit trail).

### 4. Utils — UI Helpers

Extend menus:

- New or updated main menu option: **Adopt a dog (shared custody)**
- New option: **Return a dog (end one adoption)**
- Read-only submenu or entries:
  - List dogs of a person
  - List owners of a dog
  - View all adoptions (already exists)

Add input helpers if missing (`askString`, `askInt`).

### 5. Controller — Menu-Driven UI

Update `Controller.java`:

- "Adopt a dog (shared custody)": ask for person ID and dog ID, ask fee, resolve, call `Service.adoptDog(...)`.
- "Return a dog": ask for person ID and dog ID, call `Service.returnDog(...)`.
- Allow viewing a person's current dogs and a dog's current owners (by ID).
- User **must select by ID** (no hardcoded demo data).
- Existing CRUD and buy-car flows must continue to work.

**Example main menu sketch:**
```
===== MAIN MENU =====
1. Person operations
2. Dog operations
3. Car operations
4. Buy a car (person to person)
5. View car transactions (read only)
6. Adopt a dog (shared custody)
7. Return a dog (end one adoption)
8. View dog adoptions (read only)
9. Save repository to JSON file
10. Load repository from JSON file
11. Quit
```

### 6. DataSeeder (recommended)

Seed data that exercises the many-to-many rules:

- At least one dog with **two active owners**.
- At least one person with **two active dogs**.
- Enough people and dogs so that students can test the "max reached" rules from the console.

Make sure seeded adopters are adults.

### 7. Non-Functional / Style Requirements

- All list mutations for the relationship happen **only inside Service** methods.
- Never allow direct creation/update/deletion of `DogAdoption` from the UI except through the defined use cases.
- Keep the same message and `ResultOperation` style as `buyCar` / Part 1.
- `DogAdoption` records are append-only for history; only status/contract may change on return.
- Avoid infinite recursion in `toString()` implementations.
- Defensive copies or careful encapsulation of the lists is encouraged but not required.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `Person` has `List<Dog> dogs`; `Dog` has `List<Person> owners`.
- [ ] `DogAdoption` has a `status` field (`ACTIVE` / `RETURNED`).
- [ ] `adoptDog` enforces all 7 rules and maintains both sides of the relationship.
- [ ] `returnDog` removes only the selected pair and marks the adoption `RETURNED`.
- [ ] `getDogsByOwner` and `getOwnersByDog` return correct active lists.
- [ ] `deletePerson` and `deleteDog` clean the opposite lists and mark related adoptions `RETURNED`.
- [ ] No duplicate active (person, dog) pairs are allowed.
- [ ] Max limits (3 dogs / 2 owners) are enforced.
- [ ] Controller allows adopting and returning by selecting IDs.
- [ ] DataSeeder creates at least one multi-owner dog and one multi-dog person.
- [ ] Existing `buyCar`, CRUD, and 1:1-style flows (if kept) do not regress.
- [ ] No JPA annotations appear in the Java SE source.

## Optional Extensions

- Add an `AdoptionStatus` enum instead of String.
- Implement `getActiveAdoptionsForPerson` / `getAllAdoptionsForPerson` (history vs current).
- Allow a person to "re-adopt" a previously returned dog (new ACTIVE record).
- Add a read-only "Adoption history for person/dog" submenu.
- Track a `returnDate` on the adoption when returned.

## Preparation for Spring Boot

| Java SE (this project)                     | Spring Boot / JPA equivalent                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `List<Dog> dogs` in `Person`               | `@ManyToMany` + `@JoinTable` or `@OneToMany` on join entity side  |
| `List<Person> owners` in `Dog`             | `@ManyToMany(mappedBy=...)` or inverse side of the relationship   |
| `DogAdoption` as explicit join entity      | Separate `@Entity` with `@ManyToOne` to `Person` and to `Dog`     |
| Manual list add/remove + status            | `@OneToMany` + `@ManyToOne` on `DogAdoption`; cascade management  |
| `Service.adoptDog` / `returnDog`           | `@Service` method, `@Transactional`                               |
| `Repository.addDogAdoption`                | `DogAdoptionRepository` (Spring Data JPA)                         |
| `ResultOperation`                          | `ResponseEntity` / custom DTO                                     |
| Menu option "Adopt a dog (shared)"         | `@PostMapping` in a `@RestController`                             |

## Tips

- Start with the model refactor (`Person`, `Dog`, `DogAdoption` with status).
- Implement `adoptDog` next — the duplicate check and size limits are the new interesting parts.
- Then implement `returnDog` (find the right adoption record, mutate only that pair).
- Update cascade logic in `deletePerson` / `deleteDog` early so you don't leak links.
- Use the existing `buyCar` / Part 1 `adoptDog` as templates for validation order and messaging.
- Seed multi-ownership data so the console can demonstrate shared custody.
- Keep `DogAdoption` as the source of truth for "is this pair currently active?" if you want extra safety instead of only trusting the lists.
